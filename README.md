- Full Stack Development: I enjoy creating web-based simulation tools for students pursuing health professions, giving them the ability to practice key skills and workflows they will encounter in hospitals once employed.
-  Endurance sports: I'm an avid runner, cyclist, rock climber, hiker, trail runner, etc. Hopefully one day I can move to a state with more mountains...
- Dumpster diving: I've been dumpster diving for a full decade; I get all my food from local stores' dumpsters and have funded the drilling of a well in Nigeria from auctioning the items I've found!

## Technical Background
Much of my experience comes from my work at Blue Nucleus, a GVSU ACI-based custom software development team, which I joined this past spring. My primary project has been EHR simulator for KCON's simulation course, which will allow students to work with a high-fidelty EHR model similar to the software used in local hospitals. The tech stack consists of React, Node/Express, and Postgres. I've primarily been working on the frontend, but will transition to more backend development soon and will hopefully launch a pilot this winter semester with KCON.
